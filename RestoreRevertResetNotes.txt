   GIT RESTORE | REVERT | RESET
==========================

1️⃣ RESTORE
------------
Use when you’ve made some changes in a file that are NOT committed yet 
and you want to restore the file to its previous state.

Eg. Let's say you have one file which has one line "this is a file" and this is commited.
    Now you have added one more line to it "This is second line". Since till now you have
    not staged the file with git add, so you can check the changes made with git diff command
    and if the changes are not require simply we can restore the file to its previous committed state.
Steps:
  1. Check what has changed:
       git diff
  2. Restore the file to its original version:
       git restore <file_name>

Note:
  - This command only works for uncommitted changes.
  - Once you commit, restore won’t affect those changes.


2️⃣ REVERT
------------
Use when you’ve already committed the changes but later realize you need to undo them.

Steps:
  1. View the commit history:
       git log --oneline
  2. Copy the commit hash you want to revert.
  3. Revert that commit:
       git revert <commit_hash>

What it does:
  - Creates a new commit that reverses the changes made by the selected commit.
  - Keeps the repository history intact.

Note:
  - Safe for shared repositories.
  - Does not remove commits — instead, it adds a new “undo” commit.


3️⃣ RESET
------------
Use when you want to completely remove certain commits from your branch history.

Example:
  Suppose a developer made 7 commits, but commits from #4 onwards have issues.
  Since commit #3 is the last correct one, we can reset the branch back to that point.

Command:
       git reset --soft <commit_hash>
   or  git reset --hard <commit_hash>

Explanation:
  - --soft : Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit but keeps changes staged.
  - --Mixed: Moves the HEAD pointer to the specified commit and keeps the changes into unstagged (untracked) state.
  - --hard : Moves the HEAD pointer AND removes all changes after that commit.

Warning:
  - git reset rewrites history.
  - It does NOT create logs of removed commits.
  - Use cautiously, especially on shared repositories.
