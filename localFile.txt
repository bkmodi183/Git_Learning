Problem Statement (Scenario)

1. A repository is created on GitHub and cloned locally.
2. Two files are added locally and pushed successfully to GitHub.
3. A new file is created and committed **directly on GitHub**.
4. Another file is created and committed **locally**.
5. When attempting to push the local changes, Git rejects the push because the remote branch has new commits not present locally.

Issue: Local and remote branches have diverged â€” Git refuses to push until the histories are reconciled.

Solution (Merge Remote Changes into Local)

git pull origin main --no-rebase
git push origin main

* `git pull origin main --no-rebase` merges the remote commits into your local branch.
* After resolving any merge conflicts (if present), you can push your combined changes to GitHub.
