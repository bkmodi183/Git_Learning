Git Command: git cherry-pick
--------------------------------------------

Definition:
------------
The 'git cherry-pick' command is used to apply the changes introduced by a specific commit (or multiple commits)
from one branch onto another branch without merging the entire branch. It effectively copies the selected commit's
changes and recreates them as a new commit on the current branch. The original commit remains unchanged; only its
modifications are applied to your target branch.

Use Case:
----------
The main use case for 'git cherry-pick' is to selectively bring specific commits from one branch into another.
It is particularly useful when a branch (for example, 'dev') has several commits, but you only need one particular
fix or feature in another branch (for example, 'main' or 'production') without merging all the other changes.

Typical situations include:
- Applying a hotfix from a development branch directly to a production branch.
- Reusing a specific feature or bug fix from another branch.
- Recovering a useful commit that was lost or left behind during rebasing or resets.

Real-World Example:
--------------------
Imagine a software team maintaining two branches:
- 'dev' for ongoing feature development.
- 'main' for stable production releases.

A developer fixed a critical login bug on the 'dev' branch with the commit hash a1b2c3d.
The production system (on 'main') urgently needs that same fix, but the team cannot merge
the entire 'dev' branch because it contains incomplete features.

To bring only the bug-fix commit into 'main', use the following commands:

    git checkout main
    git cherry-pick a1b2c3d

Git will apply the exact same changes introduced in that specific commit from 'dev' onto 'main'
and create a new commit representing the same fix. This allows the production branch to receive
the necessary bug fix without merging unrelated or unstable code from development.
