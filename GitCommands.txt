Git Commmands: 

1. git init -> to initialize git in your local repository.
2. git clone <repository url>
3. We have three stages when we're working in the git -> working directory, stagging area, Repository
   When we're working in file it's called as working directory space. Now once our task is finished in working directory
   we stage the file and then finally to repository.
4. git add <filename> (To stage a specific file)
5. git rm --cached <file_name> -> To unstaged a staged file
   git add . (To stage all the file present which are not staged in the working directory)
6. git commit -m "Commit message" (Here "-m" flag is used to write the commit message)
7. git status -> To check the status whether the files are stagged or commited.
8. git branch -> To check which branch you're currently working in
9. git checkout branch_name -> to switch branch
10. git checkout -b <branch_name> -> this commad create a new branch and switch to it
11. git branch -d <branch_name> -> to delete the branch in your local repository
12. git config --global user.name "username" -> to set the global username. Helpful to track which user made changes.
13. git config --global user.email "email" -> to set the global user email id
14. git remote -v -> show remote origin url if your local repo is linked with remote.
15. git remote add origin <remote_url> -> To add remote origin URL
16. git remote remove origin -> Remove origin URL
17. git fetch -> Fetch all the remote branches.
18. git push origin <branch_name> -> to push the local changes to remote branch
19. git pull origin <branch_name> -> to pull the remote changes to local branch
20. git log --oneline -> to see the logs
21. git push origin --delete branch1 -> to delete the remote branch
22. git merge <branch_name> -> First checkout to the branch to which you want to merge. Like if you want to merge the changes 
    to main branch first switch to main branch and then merge.
23. git rebase <branch_name> -> This also merge the branches but it will merge in liner fashion.
24. git cherry-pick <Hash_id> -> To bring a specific commit to a branch.
25. git restore <Hash_id> -> To undo uncommitted changes.
26. git revert <Hash_id> -> Undo committed changes (adds new)
27. git reset <Hash_id> -> Remove commits / rewrite history. To got the the older commit state.
28. git merge --squash <branch_name> && git commit -m "Commit Message" -> To sqaush the unwated commits from a branch while merging 
    and merging it to the main (or any other branch) with a single commit message which represents the unwanted commits.
29. git swtich -c <branch_name> -> To create and switch to new branch
30. git switch <branch_name> -> Switch to another branch
31. git stash -> Stash tracked changes. Used when we're working on WD and want to switch to another branch and the work is still 
    in  progress so to save the work  in WD itself without commiting it we use stash command.
32. git stash save "message"    -> Same as above but Stash with a custom message.
33. git diff ->  git diff command helps to identify the differences between the state's repositories or files
34. To avoid giving PAT token everytime when you are pushing or pulling from remote, run the below command:
    git remote set-url origin https://<your-username>:<your-PAT>@github.com/<your-username>/Docker_Learning<Repository_Name>.git
35. git branch -D <branch_name> -> To delete the local branch
36. git push origin --delete <branch-name> -> To delete the remote branch
37. git clone <url> -> to clone a remote git repository to the local git.
38. git fork <url> -> to fork a remote git repository to another remote git repository.
    Note: Remote to local is git clone & Remote to Remote is git fork.
          git clone creates a linked copy which means your remote and local repo are interconnected, while git fork creates an 
          independent copy which means it creates a new repo altogether whose owner is the person who is forking. 
39. git branch -M main -> to rename the default branch from master to Main in the remote.
40. git restore --staged <file-name> -> to unstage a staged file.
41. git log --graph --oneline --all --decorate -> to see the graphical view of branching.
