Git Commands: git merge and git rebase
--------------------------------------------

1. Definition of git merge
---------------------------
The 'git merge' command is used to combine the changes from one branch into another.
When you merge two branches, Git creates a new "merge commit" that joins their histories together.
This command keeps the full history of both branches intact and shows clearly where they diverged
and later came together.

In simple terms, merging takes the contents of a source branch (for example, 'feature') and
integrates it into the target branch (for example, 'main') without altering the existing commits.

Command example:
    git checkout main
    git merge feature

This will merge all commits from the 'feature' branch into 'main', creating a merge commit if needed.

Advantages of merging:
- Keeps a complete history of all branches and merges.
- Safe for shared branches since it does not rewrite commit history.

Disadvantages of merging:
- Can lead to a cluttered commit history with many merge commits.
- The commit graph may become more complex.

Use Case:
Merging is best when working in collaborative environments where multiple developers contribute to the
same repository. It helps preserve context and makes it easier to track when branches were integrated.

Example Scenario:
The 'dev' branch contains new features that are now ready for production.
To bring all those features into 'main', you can use:
    git checkout main
    git merge dev
This adds a merge commit that records the integration of development work into the production branch.

2. Definition of git rebase
----------------------------
The 'git rebase' command is used to move or reapply commits from one branch onto another base commit.
Instead of merging histories together, rebasing rewrites the commit history to make it appear as if
your work was created on top of the latest version of another branch.

Command example:
    git checkout feature
    git rebase main

This command takes the commits from the 'feature' branch and replays them on top of the latest 'main' branch.

Advantages of rebasing:
- Produces a cleaner, linear commit history.
- Removes unnecessary merge commits, making the history easier to read.

Disadvantages of rebasing:
- Changes commit IDs (because it rewrites history).
- Should not be used on shared branches that others are working on.

Use Case:
Rebase is best when you want to keep your feature branch up-to-date with the latest changes from 'main'
before merging it, or when you want a clean, linear project history.

Example Scenario:
You created a 'feature' branch a few days ago from 'main'.
Meanwhile, other teammates added new commits to 'main'.
Before you merge your feature branch back, you want to include the latest updates.
You can do this with:
    git checkout feature
    git rebase main
Now your branch includes all the latest 'main' changes and looks as if your commits were made after them.

3. Key Difference Between Merge and Rebase
--------------------------------------------
| Aspect              | git merge                           | git rebase                            |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Purpose              | Combines branch histories           | Moves commits to a new base            |
| Commit History       | Keeps full, branching history       | Creates a clean, linear history        |
| Commit IDs           | Stay the same                       | Are rewritten (new IDs)                |
| Merge Commit         | Usually creates a merge commit      | Does not create a merge commit         |
| Use Case             | Safe for shared branches            | Best for local feature branch cleanup  |

--------------------------------------------
Summary:
----------
- Use 'git merge' when you want to safely bring changes from one branch to another
  while preserving history.
- Use 'git rebase' when you want to maintain a clean, linear history and are working
  on your own local branch.
